# The Garden Club Manager

The subject of the application we are looking for is the efficient management of our garden club.
This entails managing our gardens as well as our members who own them.
The name of the application should be "The Garden Club Manager" and it should be available under the domain name www.the-garden-club-manager.com.

Each member is recorded with their member ID, name, birthdate and the garden(s) they own.
The relevant information for gardens would be the garden ID, its owner, how much area in square meters it covers and as a result of the latter, we classify our gardens into categories:
We have prestigious, average and budget gardens.
Thus everyone can own a garden with us – as long as they are at least 18 years old!

We need the app to be able to retrieve and show all records of each type including all their respective information.
Furthermore, we require the feature of creating new garden records as we are continuously expanding our business by building new gardens on our land.
After creating an object, we must be able to modify and update its information.
Of course, the ID of an object must never change – this attribute is how we find and distinguish the objects in our database.
This is true for gardens as well as members or assemblies.
Other than that it must be possible to update all properties of a garden – even its area.
We sometimes have cases where the garden size changes as a result of a garden expansion or – in rarer cases – a garden can even be shrunk in order to make room for another garden or simply for public space.
Obviously, this may affect the budget category, but you need not worry about this – we inspect our garden population regularly and we will manually adjust the garden category if necessary.
Of course, the owner of a garden may change over time as well as the produce it delivers.
We ask that our members adhere to our plant cultivation rules – every garden owner must dedicate a certain portion of the area to the cultivation of plants which support our species diversity.
Trees are a part of this, too, as they ensure good air quality on our premises.
Lastly, there must be an option to delete a garden record.
Gardens are sometimes bulldozed in order to either rebuild them from scratch or simply to make room for public spaces.

For the members, the features we require are much like those for the gardens:
There must be a way to easily retrieve all our members along with all their data.
Since we are a quickly growing business, we welcome new members all the time.
Thus, it must be possible to create new member records.
We also have a lot of long-time members who have recently started to buy additional gardens, where they either grow different produce or time-share the lots with their family members.
For cases like this, we must be able to update the gardens owned by a member via the app.
As a matter of fact, all properties of a member must be updatable – sometimes mistakes happen when a person’s data is entered into the system.
Therefore, even properties like their name or birthdate may be modified after the member record is created.
Unfortunately, sometimes members leave us, or have to be kicked out due to violation of our terms, or even pass away.
To deal with this, we also need a way to delete member records.

Last but not least, we need essentially all the above functionality also for our assemblies.
We want to be able to record them, modify their data retrospectively and delete them when they either expire or get canceled.
To see all our scheduled assemblies at a glance, we would like to have a feature to retrieve them all in a table, too.
